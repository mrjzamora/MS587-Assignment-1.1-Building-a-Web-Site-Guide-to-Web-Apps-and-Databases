            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Web applications are dynamic websites that interact with databases to provide users with a rich, interactive experience. In this educational page, we'll explore how these applications work, focusing on the interaction between the front-end and the back-end.</p>

        <section id="frontend">
            <h2>Front-end</h2>
            <p>The front-end is the part of the web application that users interact with and it can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which work together to create the user interface and experience. As we see in this illustration, we have many thingst that happen in the front of end of a store where we interact with point of sales, camaras, invetorory IoTs, public Wifi, etc... All the infromation has to comunicate with a back end in order to flow correctly, a web application is very simialr to this flow since it has to communicate with the back end to compute and provide the requested information.</p>

        <!-- Section explaining the back-end of web applications -->
        <section id="backend">
            <h2>Back-end</h2>
            <p>The back-end is the server-side of the web application. It processes user requests, interacts with the database, and sends the necessary data back to the front-end, just like the retail illustration we need a place to hold invetory, but more importantly, we need to create a flow on how to retreave it and store it, this can speak to volume and scale of users requesting multiple things at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Databases</h2>
            <p>Databases store the data that web applications need. They are essential for maintaining user information, processing transactions, and more.</p>

        <section id="interaction">
            <h2>Interaction Between Front-end and Back-end</h2>
            <p>When a user interacts with a web application, the front-end sends a request to the back-end. The back-end then interacts with the database, processes the request, and sends the appropriate data back to the front-end.</p>
